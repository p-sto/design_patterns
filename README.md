Design patterns
===============

Implementation of design patterns in C++17 and compiled with G++.

Inspired by series of Christopher Okhravi's [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9ejT8FO-7I&list=PLrhzvIcii6GNjpARdnO4ueTUAVR9eMBpc)
which are based on book ``Head first - design patterns``. Some additional
patterns included (not covered in video series).

General goal for ths repo is to refresh some knowledge, have personal point
of reference and have fun with C++ :)

Additonal notes and reflections regarding design patterns are [here](patterns/notes.md).
