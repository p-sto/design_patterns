Design patterns
===============

Implementation of design patterns in C++17.

Inspired by series of Christopher Okhravi's [video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9ejT8FO-7I&list=PLrhzvIcii6GNjpARdnO4ueTUAVR9eMBpc)
which is based on book ``Head first - design patterns``

Some general notes and reflections regarding design patterns are [here](patterns/notes.md).

There are 3 types of design patterns:

##### Creational:
Dealing with problem of creating objects

- [Factory](patterns/4_Factory/description.md)
- [Abstract Factory](patterns/5_Abstract_Factory/description.md)
- [Singleton](patterns/6_Singleton/description.md)  

##### Structural:
Focus on relationships between objects

- [Decorator](patterns/3_Decorator/description.md)  
- [Adapter](patterns/8_Adapter/description.md)
- [Facade](patterns/9_Facade/description.md)

##### Behavioral:
Focus on communication between objects

- [Strategy](patterns/1_Strategy/description.md)
- [Observer](patterns/2_Observer/description.md)  
- [Command](patterns/7_Command/description.md)
