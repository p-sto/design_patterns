### Adapter vs Facade vs Proxy vs Decorator

Adapter is about making two incompatible interface compatible, without 
adding any new functionality.

Facade hides complex interactions behind unified interface.

Proxy is about placing an object between other object to control communication.

Decorator is a way of adding new behaviour without changing object implementation.
